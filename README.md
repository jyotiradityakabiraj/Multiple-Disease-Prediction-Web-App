# Multiple Disease Prediction System

The Multiple Disease Prediction System is a web application that utilizes machine learning to predict the likelihood of three different diseases: diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease. The application is deployed on Streamlit, providing an intuitive and interactive user interface.

## Features

- Predicts the likelihood of diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease based on user-provided data.
- Utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze input features and generate accurate predictions.
- Provides real-time results with a user-friendly interface.
 ## Data

The data used for training the machine learning models in this application was obtained from reputable sources and may have been preprocessed to ensure optimal performance.

## Machine Learning Models

The application utilizes pre-trained machine learning models for each disease prediction task. These models have been trained on labeled datasets, and their accuracy has been evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics. Models used are SVM - Diabetes, Logical Regression - Heart Disease, SVM - Parkinson's Disease.
